# 👨‍💻 Dr. Khindol Madraimov (@tixuz)

**PhD | Full-Stack Developer | AI Research Architect**

I am a lifelong learner living at the crossroads of classical heritage and cutting-edge technology. Based in **Antalya, Turkey**, I bridge the gap between complex data structures and human-centric software solutions. My journey has taken me from assembling Il-76 aircraft in my youth to defending a PhD and now architecting AI-powered research tools.

### 🌟 About Me

I don’t just write code; I build systems that preserve and verify knowledge. Whether it’s developing an **AI-powered research assistant** to combat hallucinations in academic texts or fine-tuning local models on my **Mac-based home server**, I am driven by the pursuit of technical "Ihsan" (excellence).

* **The Academic Core:** My background in Sufi studies and Orienatal manuscripts gives me a unique perspective on data integrity and the importance of primary sources.
* **The Technical Edge:** I am currently obsessed with the "Zoo" of local AI orchestration (Ollama, Gemini API) and high-performance PHP/Laravel environments.
* **The Human Side:** When I’m not debugging Docker containers, I’m likely running along the Mediterranean, playing a competitive game of chess, or supporting my daughters in their Taekwondo journeys.

### 🚀 Current Deep Dives

I am actively expanding my stack to build more modular, scalable, and intelligent applications:

* **Backend Mastery:** Advanced **Laravel API** architecture for mobile ecosystems and **CiviCRM/WordPress** extension development (PHP & MySQL).
* **AI & Automation:** Building **Telegram Bots** with Python and MongoDB, focusing on LLM integration and local model deployment.
* **Infrastructure:** Containerization with **Docker**, Git-based CI/CD workflows, and macOS-based server optimization.

### 💡 Something to think about...

> *"The heart is a treasure chest; the tongue is its lock."* — Influenced by the teachings of Kenan Rifai, I believe our code should be as purposeful and honest as our words.
